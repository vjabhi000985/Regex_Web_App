## Regex Web App
This web application, built with Flask and deployed on AWS, is designed to help you master the art of Regular Expressions (regex).

### What are Regular Expressions?
Regex is a powerful tool for searching, manipulating, and validating text patterns. With regex, you can extract specific information from large datasets, clean up messy text, and automate tedious tasks.

### What can this Web App do?

- Test your Regex: Enter a regex pattern and test it against various input strings to see if it matches as expected.
- Explanation: Get a breakdown of your regex pattern, making it easier to understand how it works. (This feature can be implemented using libraries like regex in Python)
- Visualization: (Optional) Visualize your regex pattern to gain a more intuitive understanding of how it matches text. (Libraries like pydot can be used for visualization)
- Learn by Examples: Access a library of common regex examples for various use cases.

### Benefits:
- Save Time: Automate repetitive text processing tasks.
- Boost Accuracy: Reduce errors by validating user input with regex.
- Improve Efficiency: Extract data from complex text structures with ease.
- Level Up Your Skills: Become a regex pro and impress your colleagues.
